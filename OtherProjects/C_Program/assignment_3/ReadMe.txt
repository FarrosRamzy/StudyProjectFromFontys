This assignment is about practicing a data transmission using the encoder and decoder functions. There are 3 programs that has been built in this assignment, which are the encoder to mask the input file, a channeler to prototype an interruption, and decoder to unmask the input file into the output file. The interruption is created to replicate a situation where the input data is being corrupted during the transmission. And because of this, a method of bit flipping and parity must be used.
By using the parity bits in the encoder and the decoder algorithm, the decoder is possible to check the input value and fix the corrupted data into the correct one.
