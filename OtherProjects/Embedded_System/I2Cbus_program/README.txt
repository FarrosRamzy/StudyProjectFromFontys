This assignment is about using the I2C system for embedded program.

In the assignment A, the I2C communication is used to program an Arduino Uno to communicate with the BME280 sensor to read the correct raw value of the air environment and calculate it into a readable decimal number to the Arduino.

In the assignment B, the I2C communication is used to communicate two Arduino Unos where the master device is sending a number to the slave, then requesting the result which indicates that the value of the input number is less or more than 100.

In the assignment C, the I2C communication is used to communicate two Arduino Unos where the master device is sending two input numbers to the slave, and the slave device return the minimum and maximum number of the input.
