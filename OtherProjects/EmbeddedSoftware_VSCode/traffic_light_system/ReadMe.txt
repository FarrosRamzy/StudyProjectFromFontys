This assignment is about implementing serial communication between two Arduino Unos to replicate the basic functionality of a traffic light. One of the device is maintained to be the master device where the other is built as the slave device. The system should do the traffic flow correctly and only in the same color if it is error or being inactive such as in a blink orange mode. other than that, the color of each traffic light must be different, depending on the timing and by its sequenced protocol.
Whenever the LEDs are in the blink orange mode, the system must reset to the normal traffic light workflow after 10 seconds so the system should never be turned off if the power source is still connected.
