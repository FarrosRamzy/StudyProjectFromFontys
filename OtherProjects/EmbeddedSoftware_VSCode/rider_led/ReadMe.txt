This assignment is created to use the knowledge about bit manipulation and implementing it on a line of LEDs to show the effect of bit manipulation on a computer system.
The product that created here are a single blink LED that must be keep blinking in a correct speed whether the button which is added on the system is being pressed or not.
and a row of LEDs beside it should do a single LED sweep loop when the button is released, then a multiple LED sweep loop when the button is pressed.
The complexity of this project is to make sure that the bit register which is being manipulated do the correct thing and does not affect the single LED blink.
