This is a car simulation project for System Communication & Infrastructure learning subject.
In this project, I was working with three people with different backgrounds and origins.
I mostly handle the RCC (Remote Controller Communication) & PTC (Pressure & Temperature Communication).
However, I also took a big part with the CAN manager class which is used by all system for communication integration, and also the main logic of HIC (Headlights & Indicator Communication) to handle commands from RCC and the Dashboard.
