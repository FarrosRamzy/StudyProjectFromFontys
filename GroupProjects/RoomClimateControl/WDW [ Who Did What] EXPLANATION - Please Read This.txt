	In favor of storage space a special files has been devised which
	states which team member has been doing what in the group, to some 
	degree of detail.
		
		%-% This file will be called -> WDW <- 
					which stand for [ Who Did What - WDW ]

	=> THEREFORE,we made a folder in each folder called -> " WDW " <- which stand for "WHO DID WHAT"
			WDW = WHO DID WHAT 
			-> In which we will put a text file with the title of the folder or file name and 
			   in that file we will enumerate the name of who worked on what.
				
			<> There will be a text that reads: "Assigned To:" which logically depicts the 
			   first people that had tasks on that file/folder.

			<> Next, there will be another text that reads: "Helpers:" which logically depicts 
		           the people that intervened on that task so to quicken the process of finishing it.				

			-> If the nature is as such that it was not assigned to someone specific
			   rather it needed to be done by the whole group, it will be specified
			   in the file as such.
			
			-> At last, if the nature of the task, pice of work, or anything else is of 
		   	   such different degree that it does not fit in any of the aforementioned
			   above, it shall be specified in the file detaling the contributions of
			   that pice of work.
